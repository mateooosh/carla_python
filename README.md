Comparison of two learning algorithms with reinforcement, i.e. Deep Q-Network(DQN) and the Actor-Critic(AC) algorithm, under in terms of their use in the context of autonomous driving in a virtual environment. For this purpose, appropriate agents were created who take actions and a virtual environment that reflects the reality of road traffic.
